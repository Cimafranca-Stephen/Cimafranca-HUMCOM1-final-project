            <b><i>Procedure</i></b><br>
            Fill a pot or deep pan with oil and heat it up, batter a pork cutlet with eggs, flour, and breadcrumbs.<br>
            Deep fry the cutlet, when it finishes prepare another pan with a bit of oil, that's when you let chopped<br>
            onions and garlic simmer on the pan, beat an egg and put it in the pan after the garlic and onions get a brownish colour.<br>
            Cook the eggs on medium heat and aim for a jammy interior consistency with a firm exterior texture<br>
            Put rice in a bowl and top it with the scrambled egg, chopped cabages, and then cut your pork cutlet into strips and<br>
            top them on your eggs.
